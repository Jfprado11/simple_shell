# Simple shell - BrrBrr

## About "simple shell"

This project is a simple UNIX command interpreter. Simple Shell can be execute in two ways, the interactive and non-interactive mode.

The objective to make this project was to learn about:
- How does a shell work
- What is a pid and a ppid
- How to manipulate the environment of the current process
- What is the difference between a function and a system call
- How to create processes
- What are the three prototypes of main
- How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
- How to execute another program with the execve system call
- How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its - - children terminates
- What is EOF / “end-of-file”?

_We decided not to use several of the existing functions, to have the opportunity to develop them ourselves, all this for academic purposes._
