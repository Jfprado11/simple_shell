## About "simple shell"

This project is a simple UNIX command interpreter. Simple Shell can be execute in two ways, the interactive and non-interactive mode.

The objective to make this project was to learn about:
- How does a shell work
- What is a pid and a ppid
- How to manipulate the environment of the current process
- What is the difference between a function and a system call
- How to create processes
- What are the three prototypes of main
- How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
- How to execute another program with the execve system call
- How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its - - children terminates
- What is EOF / ‚Äúend-of-file‚Äù?

_We decided not to use several of the existing functions, to have the opportunity to develop them ourselves, all this for academic purposes._


## How to install simple shell
- You can be on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- You must clone the repository
```
https://github.com/Jfprado11/simple_shell.git
```
- You can compile in this way
```

## How to use simple shell
You can use the shell in two different modes: interactive mode and non-interactive mode
### Interactive mode
- To execute the shell in interactive mode type `./hsh`
- Now the prompt will appear and you can type any command you want, to exit the program type command `exit` or `ctrl + D`
#### Example of interactive mode
```
jfprado@JUANFE:~/simple_shell$ ./hsh
$ ls

_which.c   call_functions.c  exit_help  holberton.h    interactive.c     our_own_functions.c
$ ps

 4333 pts/0    00:00:00 hsh
 4337 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
$ exit
jfprado@JUANFE:~/simple_shell$
```
### Non-interactive mode
- To execute the non interactive mode type `echo "command" | ./hsh`
- in `"command"` you can type whatever command you want

#### Example of non-interactive mode
```
jfprado@JUANFE:~/simple_shell$ echo "pwd" | ./hsh
/home/jfprado/simple_shell
jfprado@JUANFE:~/simple_shell$ echo "ls" | ./hsh
